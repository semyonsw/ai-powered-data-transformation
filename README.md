# AI-Powered Data Transformation Framework

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent data transformation system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and apply data transformations based on natural language queries.

## Key Features

- ðŸ¤– AI-Driven Transformation Generation
- ðŸ”¬ Modular Transform Architecture
- ðŸ§© Extensible Design
- ðŸ’¡ Natural Language to Data Transformation

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-powered-data-transformation.git
cd ai-powered-data-transformation

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

1. Set your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
```

2. Prepare your input CSV file

3. Run the transformation:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

### 1. Transform Layer
- Abstract base class for data transformations
- Supports multiple transformation types:
  - Column Selection
  - Filtering
  - Aggregation

### 2. LLM Generation Layer
- Converts natural language queries to structured transforms
- Uses OpenAI's GPT models
- Generates validated transformation sequences

## Example Use Cases

```python
# Transform query: "Show high-performing employees over 40"
query = "Show me high-performing employees over 40 with salaries above $80,000"
transforms = generator.generate_transforms(query, df)
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add more transform types
- [ ] Implement multiple LLM backend support
- [ ] Enhanced transform validation
- [ ] Performance optimizations
